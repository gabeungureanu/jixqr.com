=== SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ========================================================

Contentment is the quiet sigh of a soul at peace. Savor this stillness, knowing that in the present moment, you have all you need. Regret is the echo of roads not taken. Let it guide you gently, showing you how to choose differently in the future while forgiving yourself for the past. Resentment is a weight on your shoulders, heavy and unyielding. Release it through forgiveness, freeing yourself to walk lighter and stronger. Serenity is the calm lake reflecting a clear sky. Guard this peace, letting it anchor you when life’s winds grow wild.
