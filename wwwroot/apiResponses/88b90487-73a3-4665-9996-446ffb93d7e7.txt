The Inciting Incident of a Narrative occurs at the end of Act One, and it is the pivotal moment that sets the main conflict of the story in motion. It is the event that disrupts the protagonist's ordinary world, creating the need for change and triggering the journey of their character arc. 

In the Three-Act Narrative Structure, the Inciting Incident usually occurs at around 10-20% of the story's total length, and it usually consists of three beats:

1. The Trigger or Catalyst: This is the event that sets the story in motion. It may be an internal or external event that presents a problem or challenge to the protagonist.

2. The Reaction: This is the protagonist's response to the Trigger or Catalyst. They may resist, deny, or accept the challenge, leading to a decision that sets the story's direction.

3. The Commitment: This is the final beat, where the protagonist commits to the actions needed to resolve the conflict. It may involve a change in attitude, perspective, or behavior, setting the stage for the story's main journey.

For example, in a story about a detective solving a murder case, the Inciting Incident may involve the detective discovering a body or receiving a call about a crime in progress. The Trigger or Catalyst creates the need for the detective to investigate the crime, triggering their journey of solving the case. Their Reaction may involve initial reluctance or skepticism, leading to a decision to investigate the crime further. Finally, their Commitment may involve a change in perspective or attitude towards the case, setting the stage for the main story journey.

Scene 1 of Chapter 4: The Call

Sophia sat at her desk, staring blankly at her computer screen. She let out a deep sigh and rubbed her temples, feeling the weight of the day's stress weighing her down. Suddenly, her phone rang, jolting her out of her thoughts. She hesitated for a moment before reaching for the phone and answering it.

"Hello?" she said, her voice heavy with exhaustion.

"Sophia, it's me," the voice on the other end of the line said. It was her close friend, Sarah.

"Hey, what's up?" Sophia asked, trying to sound more upbeat.

"I need to talk to you about something important," Sarah said, her tone serious.

Sophia's heart started pounding. She knew that whenever Sarah had something important to discuss, it was usually not good news. "Okay, go ahead," Sophia said, bracing herself for the worst.

"I know you've been feeling lost lately, struggling to find your purpose. I just want to say that I think I know what you need to do. I think it's time for you to answer the call." Sarah's voice was gentle but firm.

Sophia felt a wave of confusion wash over her. "What call? What are you talking about?" she asked, feeling even more lost than before.

"The call to serve ELOHIM. I truly believe that you are meant to do great things in His name. You just need to step out in faith and answer the call," Sarah said, her words ringing with conviction.

Sophia struggled to make sense of what Sarah was saying. She had grown up in a Christian family and went to church every Sunday, but she had never felt called to anything in particular. "I don't know what you mean," Sophia said, her voice trembling slightly.

"I mean that you need to trust in ELOHIM and let Him guide you. You need to let go of your fears and doubts and trust that He has a plan for you. You need to answer the call," Sarah repeated.

The words echoed in Sophia's mind, and she felt a sudden surge of inspiration and hope. She knew, deep down, that Sarah was right. She had been feeling aimless and lost for a long time, longing for a greater purpose in life. Maybe this was it. "Okay, I'll think about it," Sophia said, her voice more resolved.

"Good. I know you'll make the right decision. ELOHIM has amazing things in store for you," Sarah said, her voice full of encouragement.

Sophia hung up the phone, feeling a mixture of uncertainty and excitement. She had no idea what answering the call meant or what lay ahead, but she knew that she couldn't ignore the feeling that was growing inside her. It was time to step out in faith and let ELOHIM guide her.
